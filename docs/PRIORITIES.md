  - "Piggy bank" fee distribution - ref [#1944](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/1944) (spec)
- Reserve pool
  - Collects in a special field for now, no spending

- Simple software upgrade proposals
  - Implementation described in [#1079](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/1079)
  - Agree upon a block height to switch to new version

## Staking/Slashing/Stability

- Miscellaneous minor staking issues
  - [List here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Astaking+label%3Aprelaunch)
- Unbonding state for validators https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/1676
