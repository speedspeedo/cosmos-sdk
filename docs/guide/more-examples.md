# Plugin Examples

Now that we've seen [how to write a simple plugin](/docs/guide/example-plugin.md)
and taken a look at [how the plugin system is designed](/docs/guide/plugin-design.md),
it's time for some more advanced examples.

For now, most examples are contained in the `github.com/tendermint/basecoin-examples` repository.
In particular, we have the following:

1. [Mintcoin](https://github.com/tendermint/basecoin-examples/tree/develop/mintcoin) - a plugin for issuing new Basecoin tokens
2. [Trader](https://github.com/tendermint/basecoin-examples/tree/develop/trader) - a plugin for adding escrow and options features to Basecoin
3. [Stakecoin](https://github.com/tendermint/basecoin-examples/tree/develop/stake) - a plugin for bonding and unbonding Tendermint validators and updating the validator set accordingly
4. [PayToVote](https://github.com/tendermint/basecoin-examples/tree/develop/paytovote) - a plugin for creating issues and voting on them
5. [IBC](/docs/guide/ibc.md) - a plugin for facilitating InterBlockchain Communication
