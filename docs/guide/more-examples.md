# Plugin Examples

Now that we've seen [how to write a simple plugin](example-plugin.md)
and taken a look at [how the plugin system is designed](plugin-design.md),
it's time for some more advanced examples.

For now, most examples are contained in the `github.com/tendermint/basecoin-examples` repository.
In particular, we have the following:

1. [Mintcoin][0] - a plugin for issuing new Basecoin tokens
2. [Trader][1] - a plugin for adding escrow and options features to Basecoin
3. [Stakecoin][2] - a plugin for bonding and unbonding Tendermint validators and updating the validator set accordingly
4. [PayToVote][3] - a plugin for creating issues and voting on them
5. [IBC][4] - a plugin for facilitating InterBlockchain Communication
