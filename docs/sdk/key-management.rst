Key Management
==============

Here we cover many aspects of handling keys within the Cosmos SDK framework.

Pseudo Code
-----------

Generating an address for an ed25519 public key (in pseudo code):

::

    const TypeDistinguisher = HexToBytes("1624de6220")

    // prepend the TypeDistinguisher as Bytes
    SerializedBytes = TypeDistinguisher ++ PubKey.asBytes()

    Address = ripemd160(SerializedBytes)
